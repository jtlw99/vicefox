ArcFox is a pack of firefox improvements that brings the appearance and some of the features of arc browser to firefox. Recently, The Browser Company © (the developers of arc browser) announced a windows version, so this project almost lost the reason to exist. But there still a linux version to be made and some people just like firefox and don't want to change.

I really recomend you to give a try on arc browser if you can. But we gonna do our best to make firefox nice as arc.

- When the folder opens, search for a folder called "chrome", if you don't find it create one.
- Inside the "chrome" folder, drop the "userChrome.css" that you find on the <a href="https://github.com/use-arcrcfox/releases">releases.</a>
